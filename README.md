Write a program in C that calculates the area and the circumference of a
circle. Your program must compile without warnings by using the attached
Makefile. In your main() function, calculate perimeter and area of a 
circle with radius 4. Define PI as a preprocessor symbol and set it to
the value 3.141519.

Your output must exactly be

Area: 50.264305
Perimeter: 25.132153

You may test your program by executing 'make test' prior to comitting.
