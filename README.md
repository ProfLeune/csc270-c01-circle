# Assignment

Write a program in C that contains functions that calculate a circle's diameter,
circumference and area. The program must print the outcome of these
calculations, up to three decimals, for a circle with a radius of 4. The
circle's radius and Ï€ must be defined as a preprocessor symbol. `PI`
must be equal to `3.1415926`.

# Functional Requirements

* MUST correctly calculate diameter, circumference, and area of a circle
* MUST print output using at most three decimals

# Nonfunctional Requirements

* MUST define `PI` as a preprocessor symbol
* MUST define `RADIUS` as a preprocessor symbol
* MUST compile without warnings and errors
* MUST contain one function for each calculation
* MUST be called `circle.c`
* MUST pass `make test` successfully

# Sample run

    A circle with radius 4:
       Diameter: 8.000
       Area: 50.264
       Circumference: 25.132153
